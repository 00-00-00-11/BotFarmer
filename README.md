# SlotBot 

Currently trying to finish `auto-play` version of the bot, will be done as soon as I have time.
Auto-Grab works perfectly fine (at least from what i've seen).


# OwO 

Works perfectly fine, I've gotten banned before but how their anti-selfbot system works is that they check if you type the same command at the same timestamp as you used the command before, however ```sleep(Math.random() * (2000 - 1000) + 1000)``` will always have a random time and will bypass that. Unless you're really unlucky, I will be adding an mp3 file that will open and be loud as fuck when OwO bot dms you a captcha to finish.

# DankMemer

Works perfectly fine, never gotten banned using it and I don't even think they have an anti-selfbot system, makes 100k/24h. 


# Pollux
Currently trying to finish `auto-play` version of the bot, will be done as soon as I have time.
Auto-Pick works perfectly fine (at least from what i've seen) 

# PokeCord
Absolutely terrible, will only guess based on an array that I have. Because I was too lazy to actually make my own reverse-image-search api. But it will still guess at least.


# Information

For any errors or if any bot owners fix their bot let me know so that I can update the selfbot.
